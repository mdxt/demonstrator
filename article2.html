        So I was thinking about what to write to demonstrate Javascript. I have had to write a lot of code for regex and custom form validation
        in the past, and I wanted to do something different for this page.<br><br>
        On Saturday, I found the Canvas API, which allows us to draw graphics using Javascript and the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element.
        Among other things, it can be used for animation, game graphics, data visualization, photo manipulation, and real-time video processing.<br><br>
        Naturally, games interest me, so I found a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript">
        tutorial on MDN</a> on writing simple games. The end result of that tutorial was the following game (adapted for this webpage) - <br>
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
        <canvas id="myCanvas" class="border border-primary" width="480" height="320"></canvas><br>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary mx-auto" id="load1">Load</button><br><br>
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
        I wanted to write something simple and in a similiar vein, so here is a version of Snake - <br>
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
        <canvas id="myCanvas2" class="border border-primary" width="480" height="320"></canvas><br>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary mx-auto" id="load2">Load</button><br><br>
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
        Ofcourse, several improvements may be made to the implementaion given above. Some of them are - <br>
        At every movement, only the starting and ending cells need to be rendered, because they are the only ones
        that change. I did not do this because clearing a cell was leaving a slightly visible edge, which I was not sure
        how to remove.<br>
        From our representation of the snake, only those cells are actually needed which involve a change in direction.
        There is a bug in my code for this representation, so it has not been included currently.
